# Beginner Week 3

## Reading

Your reading for this week is:

- Chapter 6 of Creative Scala
- Chapter 7 of Creative Scala

Doing the exercises in the book chapter is optional, but highly recommended.


## Questions

1. What is a method? What are method parameters? What do methods allow us to do that we could not do before?


2. What is the syntax for a method? Write a method that takes an `Image` and returns that `Image` beside itself.


3. What are the semantics of a method call in the substitution model of evaluation?


4. What is the general idea of structural recursion?


5. How do we write a wildcard pattern (a pattern that matches anything) in a pattern match expression? If there is more than one pattern that matches the value, which one is chosen?


6. How does structural recursion work when applied to the natural numbers? What is the code skeleton we use for this in Scala for? What does this allow us to do that we could not do before?


7. Write a method that accepts an `Image` and a natural number (represented as an `Int`) and produces a horizontal row of that `Image` repeated the given number of times.


8. Using the method you just wrote create a method that accepts an `Image` and a natural number (represented as an `Int`) and produces a square of that `Image` with the side length of the square given by the natural number.


9. Write a method that accepts a natural number (represented as an `Int`) and produces a horizontal row of some image with the size changing in some way related to the `Int`. For example, the size could increase by 5 for each step down the row.


10. Write a method that accepts an `Image` and a natural number (represented as an `Int`) and produces a horizontal row of that `Image` with colors changing in some way related to the `Int`. For example, the hue could change by 5 degrees for each step down the row.
