# Beginner Week 2

## Reading

Your reading for this week is:

- Chapter 3 of Creative Scala
- Chapter 5 of Creative Scala

Doing the exercises in the book chapter is optional, but likely to be useful.


## Questions

In groups we'll answer the following questions:


1. Complete the "Evil Eye" exercise in Creative Scala, Chapter 3.


2. Create a row of shapes where the colour gradually changes from one shape to another. You can choose the shape you use and the way in which the color changes.


3. Create a picture of a house.


4. What is the result of running this program?

```scala
def example(a: Int, b: Int): Int = 
  b / 1

example(1, 42)
```

How did you arrive at your answer? Can you get to answer using a different strategy?


5. In what order does Scala evaluate expressions? How do you know this?


6. Are method parameters evaluated before or after methods are called? Can you demonstrate this?


7. Why do we care about order of evaluation? Are there kinds of programs where it makes a big difference and kinds of programs were it wouldn't matter?


8. Last week in question 10 we asked methods that return `Unit`. Now you know more would you change your answer?
