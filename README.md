# ScalaBridge London Lesson Plans

This repository contains lesson plans for [ScalaBridge London][scalabridge-london]. They are distributed under the terms of the accompanying license.

Students are divided into three streams:

1. for those with no prior programming experience;
2. for those with some programming experience, but not with Scala (or a similar FP language); and
3. for those with existing Scala experience.

We only include lesson plans for the first two streams, as those with Scala experience are few in number and diverse in needs.

This repository is organised as follows:

- `beginner`, `intermediate`, and `advanced` contain questions for each stream for use in interteaching;
- `creative-scala`, and `essential-scala` contain lectures appropriate for sections of those books, which can be used as summary lectures in interteaching
- `case-study` contains materials for case studies
